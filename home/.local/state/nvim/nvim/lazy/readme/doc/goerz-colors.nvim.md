# A Personal Neovim Colorscheme

This is a port of the
[goerz.vim](https://github.com/goerz/vimrc/blob/master/colors/goerz.vim)
colorscheme to Neovim/Lua.

It was created by adapting
[hMofiqul/vscode.nvim](https://github.com/Mofiqul/vscode.nvim) with the colors
from the original scheme.

It probably still contains a lot of bugs. For debugging, use the built-in
`:Inspect` command, and `:hi <group>` to show details of how a group is
formatted. The [norcalli/nvim-colorizer plugin](https://github.com/norcalli/nvim-colorizer.lua)
is also helpful for debugging.
