DEFEND THE FORTRESS.

HOLD POSITION.

AN IMPORTANT ADVISOR TO OUR ORGANISATION IS ON HIS WAY TO SURVEY THE
NEWLY CAPTURED FORTRESS. YOUR SQUAD HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO SAFEGUARD
HIM WHILE HE IS IN THE AREA.

|
ACCESS UPDATE:

THE ADVISOR WILL APPROACH THE FORT FROM THE EASTERN ROAD ENTRANCE.
ENSURE THAT HE HAS A CLEAR PATH TO ENTER THE FORT.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

SCANNERS INDICATE THAT THERE ARE TWO ENEMY SQUADS IN THE VICINITY.
THEY MAY PROVE TO BE A THREAT TO THE ADVISOR ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT
THEY ARE ONLY ON MANOUVERS.

|
TACTICS:

ALL FOUR AGENTS SHOULD BE DEPLOYED. MAKE GOOD USE OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL
INTELLIGENCE AND PERCEPTION VALUES. SEND AT LEAST ONE AGENT TO COVER
THE MAIN ENTRANCE AND THE REST TO COVER THE WALLS. AREA OF EFFECT
WEAPONS COULD PROVE HAZARDOUS TO THE ADVISOR SO BE CAREFUL.
