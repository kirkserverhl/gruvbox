I SHOT THE SHERIFF.

COMBAT SWEEP.

THE POLICE FORCE IN THE LOCAL CITY HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CORRUPT AND DANGEROUS TO OUR ADVERTISING EFFORTS. AFTER MEETINGS WITH
THE LOCAL CIVIC COUNCIL WE HAVE DECIDED TO HELP OUT THE HAPLESS CITIZENS BY REMOVING THEIR CORRUPT AND USELESS POLICE FORCE
AND REPLACING IT WITH ONE OF OUR OWN.

YOUR SQUAD IS TO HEAD THE CLEAN UP OPERATION BY ELIMINATING ALL POLICE OFFICERS FROM THE CITY.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE AMOUNT OF CORRUPTION WAS THE FACT THAT AT LEAST THREE ENEMY SYNDICATES HAVE GOT INTERESTS IN THE
POLICE. IF THEY GET WIND OF OUR PLAN THEN YOU CAN EXPECT DEFENCE SQUADS TO BE DEPLOYED.

|
TACTICS:

DEPLOY THE WHOLE SQUAD AND EQUIP THEM WITH LIGHT AUTOMATICS. IF AMMO STARTS TO RUN LOW THEN USE THE EQUIPMENT DROPPED BY THE
POLICEMEN.

THE TRICK TO THIS ONE IS TO MAKE A METHODICAL SWEEP THROUGH THE CITY AND NOT JUST BLAZE THROUGH ANY WHICH WAY. CLEAR EACH
HOUSE BEFORE MOVING ON TO THE NEXT.
