HEAL THE WORLD.

INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.

REPORTS HAVE BEEN COMING IN OF A NEW SUPER VIRUS CURRENTLY UNDER
DEVELOPMENT BY THE MILITARY. IT IS ONLY AT THE BLUEPRINT STAGE AT THE
MOMENT BUT WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THESE PRINTS ARE CURRENTLY IN TRANSIT
TO MILITARY RESEARCH STATIONS.

THE BLUEPRINTS ARE BEING CARRIED IN AN AMBULANCE AND WE HAVE LEARNED
THAT THIS AMBULANCE HAS JUST STOPPED OFF FOR SUPPLIES.

YOUR SQUAD IS TO PENETRATE THE BASE WHERE THE AMBULANCE IS AND
PHOTOGRAPH THE BLUEPRINTS.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

EVER SINCE OUR LAST ASSAULT ON THE BASE SECURITY HAS BEEN STEPPED UP
DRAMATICALLY. THE GUARDS ARE NOW EVEN MORE HEAVILY ARMED AND THERE
ARE A LOT MORE OF THEM.

|
TACTICS:

AS WE ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY TRANSPORT TO THIS MISSION YOU WILL
HAVE TO FIND YOUR OWN WAY INTO THE COMPLEX. ONCE THERE ENSURE THAT
NOTHING HAPPENS TO THE AMBULANCE BEFORE YOU CAN GET TO IT. AFTERWARDS
ANYTHING GOES.
