MADMAN RETURNS.

COMBAT SWEEP.

A LOCAL CRIME BOSS HAS GIVEN ENEMY SYNDICATES A WAY INTO OUR FREE AND
LIBERATED CITY. HE OBVIOUSLY HAS NO IDEA OF THE IMPURE AND VILE
NATURE OF THESE SCUM.

YOUR SQUAD IS TO REMOVE THE INFECTION AND SHOW THE TARGET THE WAY OF
OUR TRUE AND JUST RULE.

|
CITY UPDATE:

YOUR SQUAD WILL BE DROPPED IN THE SOUTHERN SECTOR OF THE CITY. AS THE
CITY IS DIVIDED BY A WALL YOU WILL HAVE TO FIND SOME METHOD OF
TRANSPORT CAPABLE OF PASSING THE GATES.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THE TARGET IS HOLED UP IN THE NORTHERN SECTOR SOMEWHERE. HE WILL ONLY
REVEAL HIS POSITION WHEN ALL OF THE ENEMY AGENTS HAVE BEEN DEALT
WITH.

|
TACTICS:

TAKE CONTROL OF THE SOUTHERN SECTOR OF THE CITY FIRST. ONCE THIS IS
CLEAR THEN COMANDEER A CAR AND HEAD NORTH. TRY TO LOOK AFTER ANY
VEHICLES THAT YOU CAN FIND AS YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THEY WILL COME IN
HANDY.
