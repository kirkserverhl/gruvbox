UNDER GUARD.

PERSONNEL ACQUISITION.

A RENOWNED RESEARCH SCIENTIST IS WORKING FOR THE MILITARY WEAPONS PROGRAM IN THE AREA ALTHOUGH SHE HAS NO IDEA OF THE IMPORTANCE
OF HER WORK. THE MILITARY ARE ANXIOUS THAT SHE COMPLETES HER RESEARCH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND CONSEQUENTLY SHE IS UNDER HEAVY
GUARD.

OUR RESEARCH AND DESIGN BOYS WOULD DEARLY LIKE TO HAVE A CHAT WITH HER AND FIND OUT WHAT SHE KNOWS.

YOUR SQUAD MUST <PERSUADE> THE NOTABLE SCIENTIST TO COME AND SEE THE R AND D LADS.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

WHILST SHE IS WORKING IN THE RESEARCH BUILDING THERE IS A VERY STRONG SECURITY PRESENCE. THESE GUARDS ARE WELL EQUIPPED AND
VERY WELL TRAINED ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY NOT TO OUR STANDARDS.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

RATHER THAN KEEP HER LOCKED AWAY FOR ALL HOURS THE TARGET IS OCCASIONALLY ALLOWED OUT FOR A WALK NOW AND AGAIN. THIS IS DEFINITELY
WHEN SHE IS AT HER MOST VULNERABLE. EVEN SO THERE ARE STILL GUARDS ALONG THE WAY.

|
TACTICS:

IF EVER THERE WAS A JOB FOR A SNIPER THEN THIS IS IT. TWO AGENTS SHOULD BE DEPLOYED. ONE WITH A PERSUADERTRON AND THE OTHER WITH
A LONG RANGE RIFLE. MAKE A DETAILED STUDY OF THE AREA AND SPECIFICALLY THE GUARD POINTS ALONG THE WAY BEFORE MAKING YOUR MOVE.
THE AGENT WITH THE LONG RANGE RIFLE SHOULD PICK OFF THE GUARDS FROM MAXIMUM RANGE WHILE THE OTHER AGENT MOVES IN AND <PERSUADES>
THE TARGET. TAKE CARE NOT TO ALERT THE GUARDS AS THEY MAY ACCIDENTALLY CATCH THE SCIENTIST WITH A STRAY SHOT.
