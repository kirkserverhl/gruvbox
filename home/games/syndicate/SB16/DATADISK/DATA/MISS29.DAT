SCIENCE PROJECT.

PERSONNEL ACQUISITION.

A TALENTED SCIENTIST WORKING FOR AN ENEMY SYNDICATE HAS DEVELOPED A
DEVICE TO COUNTER OUR PERSUADOTRON. AT THE MOMENT IT HAS REACHED THE
ALPHA STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT.

OBVIOUSLY IF FULLY DEVELOPED AND SUCCESSFUL IT WILL SERIOUSLY HAMPER
OUR SCOPE OF OPERATIONS IN THIS AREA.

YOUR SQUAD IS TO <PERSUADE> THE SCIENTIST TO COME AND HAVE A FRIENDLY
CHAT WITH US.

|
CIVILLIAN UPDATE:

AROUND HALF OF THE CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN ISSUED WITH THIS NEW DEVICE
AND WILL BE VERY HARD TO <PERSUADE>.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

AS THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PROJECT YOU CAN EXPECT THEIR TO BE ENEMY
AGENTS IN THE VICINITY. NO FURTHER INFORMATION IS AVALIABLE AT THIS
TIME.

|
TACTICS:

LEAVE THE CIVVIES ALONE. THEY ARE OF NO USE TO YOU AND DISRUPTING
THEM WILL ONLY INVOLVE THE POLICE FORCE. BE CAREFUL WHEN USING AREA
OF EFFECT WEAPONRY NEAR THE TARGET.
