INFORMATION STUDIES.

PERSONNEL ACQUISITION.

TWO NOTED REPORTERS ARE BOTH STAYING IN A NEARBY CITY. WITH THEIR JOURNALIST CONNECTIONS THEY COULD PROVIDE A VALUABLE SOURCE
OF INFORMATION. THEY WILL OF COURSE REQUIRE THE RIGHT PREPARATION AND MOTIVATION.

YOUR SQUAD WILL BE DEPLOYED TO <PERSUADE> THE REPORTERS TO JOIN OUR WORTHWHILE CAUSE.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

REPORTS SHOW THAT THERE IS ALSO AN ENEMY TACTICAL SQUAD ACTIVE IN THE AREA. WHILST THEY WOULD HAVE NO REASON TO INTERFERE WITH
THE TARGETS THEY MAY POSE A PROBLEM IF THEY BECOME AWARE OF OUR PRESENCE.

|
TACTICS:

ITS A CAKEWALK REALLY. ONE AGENT WITH A PERSUADERTRON SHOULD BE DEPLOYED FOR EACH OF THE TARGETS AND A THIRD COULD KEEP AN EYE
ON THE ENEMY SQUAD. NO ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE TO ENGAGE THE ENEMY AND YOU SHOULD ONLY FIRE IF FIRED UPON. ENSURE THAT THE TARGETS
ARE SAFE FROM ANY CROSSFIRE IF A MELEE ENSUES.
