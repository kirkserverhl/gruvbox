HOSTILE TAKEOVER.

PERSONNEL AQUISITION.

A RIVAL CORPORATION IS RIPE FOR A TAKEOVER BID. ITS GOVERNING
SYNDICATE HAS SUSTAINED FAR TOO MANY LOSSES TO BE A THREAT TO US.

ONE OF THE CORPORATE EXECUTIVES IS CURRENTLY UNDER GUARD IN A NEARBY
INSTALLATION. YOUR SQUAD IS TO <PERSUADE> HIM TO HELP US IN THIS
VENTURE.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THE TARGET IS LOCATED IN A BUILDING IN THE SOUTH EAST OF THE CITY.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

HE IS BELIEVED TO BE UNDER HEAVY GUARD AWAITING A PICKUP BY THE
MILITARY. EXPECT STIFF RESISTANCE AND SOME VERY HEAVY FIREPOWER.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

WHILST THE TARGET SYNDICATE IS SERIOUSLY UNDER STRENGTH THERE ARE
SEVERAL OTHER SYNDICATES WHO SEEM TO HAVE THE SAME IDEA AS US. EXPECT
A FEW COMBAT PATROLS IN THE AREA.

|
TACTICS:

THE HARDEST PART ABOUT THIS MISSION IS GOING TO BE NOT GETTING THE
TARGET KILLED BY A STRAY SHOT. TRY TO ENTICE THE GUARDS OUT INTO THE
OPEN AND DONT ATTEMPT TO <PERSUADE> THE TARGET UNTIL THEY HAVE BEEN
DEALT WITH.
