THE PAYOFF.

ASSASSINATION.

THE CORRUPT MAYOR OF THE NEARBY CITY HAS BEEN SPONGING FROM THE GOOD CITIZENS FOR MONTHS NOW. THE PEOPLE ARE GETTING FED UP WITH
HIM AND NOW IS AN IDEAL TIME FOR THEM TO BE SHOWN THE LIGHT OF OUR SYNDICATE AND GLORY OF OUR LEADERSHIP.

BUT FIRST THE MAYOR MUST BE ELIMINATED. THAT IS WHERE YOUR SQUAD COMES IN.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THE TARGET IS CURRENTLY IN A CONFERENCE WITH HIS CHIEFS OF STAFF AND SO NOW IS THE BEST TIME TO STRIKE. THE MEETING IS TAKING
PLACE IN A LARGE BUILDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

SEVERAL OTHER SYNDICATES HAVE ALSO NOTICED THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY AND HAVE SENT SQUADS TO INTERFERE WITH OUR CAUSE. THE LATEST
INTELLIGENCE REPORTS INDICATE THAT AT LEAST THREE SYNDICATES HAVE SHOWN AN INTEREST AND SENT COMBAT SQUADS.

|
TACTICS:

THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WILL BE ACTUALLY REACHING THE TARGET WITHOUT RUNNING INTO AN ENEMY SQUAD. FOR THIS REASON THE WHOLE SQUAD
SHOULD BE DEPLOYED WITH STANDARD COMBAT PATROL EQUIPMENT. YOUR BEST BET IS TO DEAL WITH THE ENEMY SYNDICATES BEFORE TURNING
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION ON THE MAYOR. ONCE YOU REACH THE TARGET BUILDING SPLIT YOUR SQUAD AND SEND MEN IN BOTH ENTRANCES
TAKING CARE OF THE GUARDS FROM LONG RANGE FIRST. AFTER THAT ITS A CAKEWALK.
