1ST RECON SQUAD.

RECONNAISSANCE.

AS A PRIMARY STEP TO THE TAKING OF A CITY YOU ARE TO LAND A RECON PATROL TO INVESTIGATE THE TARGET AREA.

YOUR SQUAD WILL BE LANDED AT THE DOCKS IN THE SOUTHWEST OF THE CITY AND YOU ARE TO SECURE A BEACH HEAD AND CONDUCT A SWEEP OF THE
SURROUNDING AREA.

ANY ENEMY SYNDICATE FORCES YOU ENCOUNTER MUST BE ELIMINATED. ONCE THIS IS ACHIEVED THEN RETURN TO THE DOCKS FOR RETRIEVAL.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

ENEMY SQUADS ARE BELIEVED TO BE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND SOPHISTICATED SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT WILL DETECT THE LANDING CRAFT
LONG BEFORE YOU REACH THE DOCKS. YOU SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR VERY STIFF OPPOSITION.

|
TACTICS:

THE FULL SQUAD SHOULD BE DEPLOYED FOR THE SWEEP. AS LONG AS YOU KEEP THEM TOGETHER AND JUICED UP THERE SHOULD BE NO REAL PROBLEM.
UZIS BACKED UP WITH LONGER RANGE SUPPORT ARE ALL THAT IS NECESSARY BUT YOU SHOULD NOT OVERLOOK MEDIKITS.
