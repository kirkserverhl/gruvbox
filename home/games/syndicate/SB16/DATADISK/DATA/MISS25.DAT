STIR CRAZY.

RAID AND RESCUE.

ONE OF OUR INFORMERS HAS BEEN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO GET ARRESTED BY THE POLICE. NEWS OF THIS ARRIVED TOO LATE FOR US TO INFLUENCE
HIS TRIAL AND HE IS CURRENTLY INCARCERATED IN THE LOCAL PENITENTIARY.

HE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE USEFUL INFORMATION REGARDING LOCAL SYNDICATE ACTIVITY BUT WE ARE SERIOUSLY RESTRICTED IN THE AMOUNT WE
CAN GAIN WHILST HE IS INSIDE. WE HAVE TRIED LEANING ON THE PRISON AUTHORITIES BUT THEY ARE PROTECTED BY A RIVAL SYNDICATE.

YOUR SQUAD IS TO BREAK INTO THE PRISON AND RESCUE THE INFORMER. HE HAS BEEN BRIEFED ON THE PLAN AND HE IS WAITING FOR YOU.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

BEING A PRISON THE DEFENCES ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH KEEPING PEOPLE IN THAN KEEPING PEOPLE OUT. THE EXERCISE YARD WHERE THE
PRISONERS ARE IS ACCESSIBLE BY A LARGE GATE.

MOST OF THE SECURITY PERSONNEL PATROL THE COURTYARD ON CATWALKS RAISED ABOVE GROUND LEVEL AND THERE ARE TWO MORE GUARDS ON
THE WATCH TOWER ABOVE THE GATE. THE REMAINDER OF THE SECURITY FORCES ARE IN A BUILDING TO THE EAST OF THE MAIN PRISON.

WE BELIEVE THEM TO BE QUITE WELL EQUIPPED.

|
INFORMER UPDATE:

THE LAST MESSAGE HE MANAGED TO GET TO US CONCERNED AN ASSAULT WEAPON THAT HE MANAGED TO HIDE PRIOR TO ENTERING THE CITY BUT
UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THE MESSAGE WAS GARBLED.

|
TACTICS:
FAST IN FAST OUT IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY. THE TRANSPORT DIVISION HAS PROVIDED A CAR FOR THIS MISSION. LOOK AFTER IT WELL AS
IT IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THE COURTYARD. WHEN YOU ENTER THE YARD OUR MAN WILL BE WAITING NEXT TO THE LIGHTS
IN THE CENTRE OF THE YARD. PULL UP NEXT TO HIM AND WAIT FOR HIM TO GET INTO THE CAR BEFORE RETURNING TO THE PICKUP POINT AS
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

IT ONLY TAKES ONE AGENT TO DRIVE A CAR BUT PASSENGERS COULD PROVIDE COVER FIRE AND TAKE OUT ANY GUARDS THAT GET IN THE WAY.
