CLEAN SWEEP.

COMBAT SWEEP.

AN ENEMY SYNDICATE HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS WITH THE POPULATION OF A NEARBY CITY. THIS IS MAINLY DUE TO SUBVERSIVE
TECHNIQUES FROM OUR ESPIONAGE DEPARTMENT.

AS A RESULT OF THIS THE ENEMY SYNDICATE HAS PULLED OUT MOST OF ITS FORCES FROM THE SURROUNDING AREA AND THE CITY HAS FALLEN
OPEN FOR US TO TAKE.

YOUR SQUAD IS TO CONDUCT A RECONNAISSANCE SWEEP OF THE AREA TO CLEAR OUT ANY ENEMY SYNDICATE AGENTS REMAINING INSIDE CITY LIMITS
BEFORE RETURNING TO THE PICK UP POINT.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

THE ENEMY SQUAD IS SERIOUSLY UNDER STRENGTH AND POORLY EQUIPPED. THE POLICE FORCE IS ALMOST NON EXISTENT AND SHOULDNT PROVIDE
ANY MORE PROBLEM FOR YOU THAN IT DOES FOR THEM.

|
TACTICS:

SMALL ARMS WITH AUTOMATICS FOR SUPPORT ARE ALL THAT ARE REALLY NEEDED FOR THIS MISSION. A SQUAD OF TWO AGENTS COULD COVER THE
CITY IN ALMOST NO TIME AT ALL. EITHER KEEP BOTH AGENTS TIGHT TO EACH OTHER AND CONCENTRATE FIREPOWER ON INDIVIDUAL TARGETS
OR DRAG ONE AGENT FURTHER BEHIND WITH LONGER RANGED EQUIPMENT TO PROVIDE COVER FOR THE FIRST.
