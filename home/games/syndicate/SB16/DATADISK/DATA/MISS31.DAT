EVERY FORMATION A PARADE.

ASSASSINATION.

A SEVERE INFORMATION LEAK FROM A MOLE IN OUR INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT HAS FOUND ITS WAY TO A LOCAL OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF THE
MILITARY ACTIVITIES IN THE AREA. SINCE THEN THE MOLE HAS BEEN DEALT WITH BUT THAT STILL LEAVES THE PROBLEM OF THIS INFORMATION
FLOATING AROUND.

WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE SAME OFFICIAL IS TO ATTEND AN INSPECTION AT THE LOCAL BARRACKS. SECURITY AROUND THE BARRACKS IS TOO
HIGH FOR US TO DROP YOU INTO THE COMPLEX ITSELF SO YOUR SQUAD WILL BE DEPLOYED SOMEWHERE AROUND THE PERIMETER AND YOU WILL HAVE
TO FIND YOUR OWN WAY INSIDE.

ONCE INSIDE THE OFFICIAL MUST BE ASSASSINATED.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THE TARGET IS BEING GREETED BY THE BASE COMMANDER AT THE NORTH SIDE TRANSPORT DECK. AS HE HAS JUST ARRIVED BY CAR HE MAY ATTEMPT
TO LEAVE IF HE SEES YOU.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

BEING A MILITARY INSTALLATION YOU CAN EXPECT HEAVY DEFENCES. MOST OF THE FOOT SOLDIERS ARE EQUIPPED WITH LIGHT AUTOMATICS BUT
THERE ARE ALSO SOME HEAVY WEAPONS SPECIALISTS. IT IS NOT KNOWN EXACTLY HOW MANY MEN ARE PRESENT AT THIS TIME BUT THE FIGURE
IS DEFINITELY IN THE THIRTIES.

|
TACTICS:

THE FIRST TASK WILL BE GETTING INTO THE COMPLEX ITSELF. SOME FORM OF TRANSPORT IS DEFINITELY REQUIRED. ONCE THERE KEEP YOUR TEAM
TIGHT AND KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN FOR AMBUSHES. CONCENTRATE FIRE ON THE HEAVY WEAPONS SPECIALISTS AS THEY WILL PROVIDE THE MOST
DANGER TO THE SQUAD. ONCE THE TARGET IS ELIMINATED AN ARMOURED TRANSPORT WILL ARRIVE TO TAKE YOU TO THE PICKUP POINT. IT WILL
NOT HANG AROUND SO YOU HAVE TO BE ON YOUR TOES.
