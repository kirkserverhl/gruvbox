RANSOM.

ASSAULT.

A TEAM OF BANDITS HAS TAKEN OVER A SMALL RESEARCH COMPLEX IN THE AREA AND THEY ARE HOLDING THE CITY TO RANSOM AND TERRIFYING THE
PEOPLE. THEIR LEADER IS AN EX ARMY CORPORAL WHO HAS TRAINED HIS OWN MEN AND USES THEM TO GUARD THE AREA. HE MUST BE TAKEN OUT.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

AS FAR AS WE KNOW THEIR WEAPONS CONSIST MAINLY OF LIGHT MACHINE GUNS WITH AN OCCASIONAL MINI GUN. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THERE ARE
A LOT OF GUARDS AND REPORTS INDICATE THAT THEY ARE QUITE WELL TRAINED AS A GROUP.

|
TACTICS:

AS THERE IS ONLY ONE ENTRANCE TO THE ACTUAL COMPLEX CAUTION MUST BE USED IN THE ASSAULT. LONG RANGE WEAPONS SHOULD BE DEPLOYED TO
TAKE OUT ANY PERIMETER GUARDS WHILST HEAVY WEAPONS ARE USED TO TAKE OUT CONCENTRATED GUARD FORMATIONS. WITH ANY LUCK HE MAY HAVE
UNDERESTIMATED OUR WEAPONS TECHNOLOGY AND YOU MAY BE ABLE TO PICK HIM OFF WITHOUT ENTERING THE CAMP. IF YOU ARE FORCED TO ENTER
THE CAMP TRY TO TAKE THE GUARDS ON ONE AT A TIME AND NOT LET THEM RUSH YOU AS A GROUP.
