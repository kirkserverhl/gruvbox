GUARD DUTY.

STRUCTURE DEFENCE.

FOLLOWING OUR SUCCESS IN SECURING THE ATLANTIC ACCELERATOR RESEARCH
STATION SEVERAL OTHER SYNDICATES HAVE BECOME EVEN MORE INTERESTED
IN THE OWNERSHIP OF SUCH A STATION. WE ANTICIPATE A COUNTER STRIKE
ANY DAY NOW.

YOUR SQUAD IS TO DEFEND THE STATION AGAINST SUCH AN ATTACK UNTIL WE
CAN SHIP FURTHER PERSONNEL TO THE STRUCTURE.

|
MILITARY UPDATE:

IN ADDITION TO ENEMY SYNDICATE ACTIVITY WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE
MILITARY HAVE SENT SEVERAL SPOTTER UNITS TO PROVIDE FORWARD
OBSERVATION FOR AIR STRIKE MISSIONS. BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR MILITARY
PERSONNEL IN THE AREA.

|
TACTICS:

NOTHING SPECIAL. JUST KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED.
