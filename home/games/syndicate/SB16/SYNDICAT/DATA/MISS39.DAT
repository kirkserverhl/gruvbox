PERSONNEL ACQUISITION.

A SQUAD OF EARLY MODEL AGENTS HAS GONE HAYWIRE IN THE LOCAL CITY. THEIR CHIPS HAVE BEEN DAMAGED AND THEY WILL NOT RESPOND TO THEIR
CONTROL CODES.

YOUR SQUAD MUST ENTER THE CITY AND <PERSUADE> THEM TO RETURN TO BASE FOR REPROGRAMMING.

SYNDICATE UPDATE:

AT LEAST TWO OTHER SYNDICATES HAVE BEEN SHOWING AN INTEREST IN GETTING THEIR HANDS ON OUR CYBORGS AND INTELLIGENCE REPORTS SHOW
THAT SEVERAL SQUADS ARE ON THEIR WAY TO THE CITY. THEY MUST NOT BE ALLOWED NEAR THE OLD AGENTS.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

WITH THEIR CHIPS GOING HAYWIRE THE SIGNALS FROM THE PERSUADERTRON MAY APPEAR GARBLED AND YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY <PERSUADING> THEM
OTHERWISE.

TACTICS:

THE HARDEST PART ABOUT THIS MISSION WILL BE IDENTIFYING THE FRIENDLY AGENTS AND DISTINGUISHING THEM FROM THE ENEMY ONES. CHECK
YOUR SCANNER AS YOUR TARGETS WILL NOT APPEAR AS THREATS. ACCURATE WEAPONS ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS AS AREA OF EFFECT OR SPRAY FIRE
WEAPONRY INCREASES THE CHANCE OF DAMAGE TO ONE OF THE TARGETS.
