THE LADY IS A TRAMP.

PERSONNEL ACQUISITION.

MISS WESTWOOD HAS BEEN THREATENING ONE OF OUR EXECS WITH A SCANDAL UNLESS HE CONFORMS TO HER DEMANDS. HE HAS FOUND HER PERSISTENCE
ANNOYING AND WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO CHANGE HER POINT OF VIEW.

YOUR SQUAD MUST <PERSUADE> MISS WESTWOOD TO COME ROUND TO OUR WAY OF THINKING AND BRING HER BACK TO THE LANDING ZONE FOR A PICKUP.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

AT LEAST TWO ENEMY SYNDICATES HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN MISS WESTWOODS WELL BEING AND HAVE DISPATCHED SQUADS ACCORDINGLY.
THESE MAY POSE PROBLEMS TO THE MISSION AND YOU ARE QUITE FREE TO DEAL WITH THEM AS YOU SEE FIT.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THE TARGET IS BELIEVED TO LIVE IN A SMALL HOUSE IN THE SOUTHEAST OF THE CITY. WE THINK SHE MAY HAVE EMPLOYED A BODYGUARD ALTHOUGH
THIS HAS YET TO BE CONFIRMED.

|
TACTICS:

THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH THIS MISSION WILL BE THE ENEMY SYNDICATE SQUADS WHO MAY POSE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT. WITH THIS IN MIND YOU
SHOULD DEPLOY THE FULL SQUAD WITH THE BEST AVAILABLE WEAPONRY AND A FEW MEDIKITS. AT LEAST ONE SHOULD CARRY THE PERSUADOTRON FOR
THE TARGET. WHILST THIS AGENT PROCEEDS WITH THE MISSION THE OTHERS CAN CONCENTRATE ON KEEPING THE ENEMY AWAY FROM THE TARGET
AND YOUR AGENT.
