RAIDERS.

ASSASSINATION.

AN ENEMY SYNDICATE HAS BRAINWASHED A NOTABLE SCIENTIST WHO NOW WORKS FOR THEM. HE HAS IMPROVED THEIR EQUIPMENT A TREMENDOUS 
AMOUNT AND IS A SERIOUS ASSET.

UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE INSERTED A SMALL CHIP IN HIS BRAIN WHICH DETECTS THE ACTIVITY OF THE PERSUADERTRON AND BLOCKS THE SIGNAL
MAKING HIM IMMUNE TO <PERSUASION>.

HE CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE HIS RESEARCH FOR THE ENEMY AND SO HE MUST BE ELIMINATED.

|
CITY UPDATE:

THE CITY IS QUITE SMALL AND RELATIVELY UNDEFENDED. A SMALL SQUAD SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEMS IN REACHING THE INSTALLATION IN THE 
SOUTH WEST SECTOR AND ACHIEVING THE MISSION OBJECTIVE.

|
TACTICS:

RESISTANCE IS EXPECTED TO BE QUITE LIGHT SO HEAVY WEAPONS WILL NOT BE NEEDED. INDEED IT WOULD BE RISKY ALLOWING SUCH TECHNOLOGY
TO POSSIBLY FALL INTO ENEMY HANDS. PROCEED WITH ALL SPEED TO THE INSTALLATION IGNORING ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF THE CITY. KEEP IT
TIGHT AND YOU SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEMS.
