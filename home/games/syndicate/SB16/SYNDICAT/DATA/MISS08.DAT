EX750 CAPTURE.

EQUIPMENT ACQUISITION.

THE ARMY HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW ANTI TANK WEAPON AND OUR RESEARCH BOYS WANT IT.

IT HAS BEEN DESIGNED AND BUILT IN THE SARACEN MILITARY BASE IN THE SOUTH EAST OF THE CITY AND WE BELIEVE IT IS STILL STORED ON THE
BASE.

|
GENERAL UPDATE:

THE FIRST TASK IS TO REACH THE BASE. THIS IS HARDER THAN IT SOUNDS AS THE ARMY RECEIVED SOME BACKING FROM A RIVAL SYNDICATE. AS 
THE SYNDICATE DOESNT WANT ITS INVESTMENT TO BE LOST BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR ENEMY AGENTS.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

BEING A MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT THE BASE IS OBVIOUSLY WELL DEFENDED. THE DEFENDERS ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE LATEST
MILITARY HARDWARE SO EXPECT SOME SERIOUS RESISTANCE.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

WE BELIEVE THE WEAPON ITSELF IS HELD IN A LOCKED BUILDING IN THE SOUTH OF THE BASE.

|
TACTICS:

A WHOLE SQUAD SHOULD BE DEPLOYED. SPLIT THE SQUAD INTO 2 GROUPS FOR THE MOVE ON THE CAMP. THAT WAY IF ONE OF THEM IS WIPED OUT YOU 
WILL STILL HAVE A CHANCE WITH THE SECOND.

LONG RANGE GUNS OR HEAVY WEAPONS SHOULD BE USED TO TAKE OUT THE PERIMETER GUARDS AND MINI GUNS SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THE REST.
