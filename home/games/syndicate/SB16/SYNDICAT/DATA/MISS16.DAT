PERSONNEL ACQUISITION.

A SMALL WEAPONS SUPPLIER OF OURS IS BEING LEANED ON BY THE MILITARY AND WE ARE NOW EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTY WITH OUR HARDWARE
SUPPLIES.

WE BELIEVE THE REASON BEHIND THIS IS A MR CARSON WHO HAS BEEN DIVULGING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION TO THE MILITARY. HE HAS BEEN
UNDER SURVEILLANCE FOR SOME TIME NOW AND HE HAS JUST CONFIRMED OUR SUSPICIONS BY VISITING A MILITARY TRAINING CAMP.

ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE FAR SIMPLER JUST TO KILL HIM HE MAY HAVE INFORMATION THAT WE COULD USE ABOUT THE MILITARY AND SO YOUR
SQUAD IS TO ASSAULT THE CAMP AND <PERSUADE> MR CARSON.

ONCE HE HAS BEEN PERSUADED PROCEED TO THE LANDING STRIP IN THE CAMP FOR DUST OFF.

|
TRANSPORT UPDATE:

THE CAMP IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE MAIN GATE AND THE TRANSPORT DIVISION HAS PROVIDED A GROUND CAR FOR THIS MISSION.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A VERY STRONG MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE AREA ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THEM TO BE ARMED MAINLY WITH LIGHT AUTOMATICS.
THERE ARE ALSO A SERIES OF GUARD TOWERS THAT LINE THE PERIMETER FENCE. IT IS UNKNOWN WHAT SORT OF FIREPOWER THESE HAVE BUT THEY
SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT AT ANY OPPORTUNITY.

|
TACTICS:

LONG RANGE SNIPING SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THE TOWER GUARDS BUT BE SURE TO DO IT AT MAXIMUM RANGE OTHERWISE YOU COULD BE IN FOR
SOME SERIOUS RETURN FIRE. ONE AGENT SHOULD DRAG BEHIND THE OTHERS TO PROVIDE COVER FIRE WITH LONG RANGE WEAPONRY. HEAVY WEAPONS
OR AREA OF EFFECT WEAPONS SHOULD NOT BE USED DUE TO THE PROXIMITY OF THE ENEMY AND POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO THE TARGET. AS SOON AS
YOU ENTER THE CAMP EXPECT THE SOLDIERS TO COME AT YOU THICK AND FAST.
