VENGEANCE.

ASSASSINATION.

TWO STREET PUNKS FROM THE NEARBY CITY HAVE BEEN ACTING AS INFORMERS AGAINST US FOR AN ENEMY SYNDICATE. THEY HAVE BEEN PASSING ON
INFORMATION REGARDING OUR TRAINING AND SCOUT ACTIVITIES IN THE AREA.

THIS IS OBVIOUSLY DETRIMENTAL TO OUR SCOPE OF OPERATIONS IN THIS AREA AND SO WE HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST THEM.

YOUR SQUAD IS TO ENFORCE A STRICT NO INFORMATION POLICY ON THE TWO PEOPLE IN QUESTION. PREFERABLY WITH A LOT OF AMMO.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

WE BELIEVE THAT THEY KNOW WE ARE AFTER THEM AND THAT THEY HAVE PASSED THIS INFORMATION ON TO THEIR CONTACTS. YOU CAN EXPECT
TO MEET RESISTANCE FROM SEVERAL ENEMY STRIKE SQUADS.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THE TARGETS HAVE SPLIT UP IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE YOUR JOB HARDER. WE SUSPECT THAT THEY ARE HOLED UP IN INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS IN
THE EAST AND THE SOUTH OF THE CITY.

|
TACTICS:

TRY TO DEAL WITH THE ENEMY SQUADS FIRST AS THEY WILL BE TOO MUCH OF A DISTRACTION WHEN IT COMES TO THE TARGETS. WHEN THE ENEMY
AGENTS ARE DESTROYED THEN ITS UP TO YOU WHETHER YOU PERSUE THE TARGETS ONE AT A TIME OR BOTH AT ONCE. WE ONLY KNOW THE LOCATION
OF THE FIRST TARGET AT THIS TIME SO ITS PROBABLY BETTER TO DO IT ONE AFTER THE OTHER.
