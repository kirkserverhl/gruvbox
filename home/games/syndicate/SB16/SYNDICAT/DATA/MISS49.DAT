PERSONNEL ACQUISITION.

AN ENEMY UNDERCOVER AGENT HAS MALFUNCTIONED AND IS OBVIOUSLY NOT RESPONDING TO ANY OF ITS CONTROL COMMANDS. INTELLIGENCE
BELIEVES THAT HE HAD ACCESS TO HIGH LEVEL INFORMATION WHICH WOULD BE OF GREAT USE TO OUR INTELLIGENCE BOYS.

YOUR SQUAD HAS BEEN ISSUED WITH A REMOTE PORTABLE UPLINK DEVICE WHICH ATTACHES ONTO THE PERSUADERTRON. WHEN THE SUBJECT
IS <PERSUADED> THEN ANY RELEVANT INFORMATION IS IMMEDIATELY BEAMED BY SATELLITE TO HEAD OFFICE.

YOU MUST DIRECT YOUR SQUAD IN TO <PERSUADE> THE ENEMY AGENT BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE GETS TO HIM.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

AT LEAST THREE ENEMY SQUADS ARE EN ROUTE TO DEAL WITH THE TARGET. IF THEY REACH HIM BEFORE YOU THEY WILL PROBABLY KILL HIM
AND WE WILL HAVE LOST THE CHANCE FOR THAT INFORMATION.

|
TACTICS:

A SINGLE AGENT WITH A PERSUADERTRON WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE CITY WITH THE MINIMUM OF FUSS AND <PERSUADE> THE TARGET.
ONCE THE UPLINK IS ACHIEVED THEN THE MISSION WILL END AS HEAD OFFICE WILL HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THEY NEED.
