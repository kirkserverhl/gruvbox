THE FAMILIES.

ASSASSINATION.

THE NEARBY CITY IS RIDDLED WITH ORGANISED CRIME. IT IS DIVIDED UP BY SEVERAL CRIME FAMILIES OF LITTLE NOTE AND THE CITIZENS ARE
GETTING REALLY FED UP WITH THE WHOLE AFFAIR.

IT IS TIME FOR US TO DO OUR GOOD SAMARITAN ACT AND STEP IN TO SHOW THESE CRIME FAMILIES WHAT REAL POWER ENTAILS.

YOUR MISSION IS TO ASSASSINATE THE HEADS OF THE FAMILIES AS THEY ATTEND THEIR MONTHLY MEETING.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

CRIME FAMILIES DO NOT NORMALLY TRUST EACH OTHER AND THIS IS APPARENT IN THE FACT THAT EACH FAMILY HAS BROUGHT ALONG A HOST OF
ARMED BODYGUARDS. FURTHER GUARDS LOOK AFTER THE BUILDING ENTRANCE AND EVEN MORE COVER THE GROUNDS. THE POLICE FORCE IS IN THE
POCKET OF ALL OF THEM SO YOU CANNOT EXPECT ANY HELP FROM THEM. IN FACT IF YOU START SHOOTING UP THE GUARDS THE POLICE ARE
MORE LIKELY TO INTERVENE ON THEIR SIDE.

|
TACTICS:

FAST IN FAST OUT IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY. LIGHT AUTOMATICS SHOULD BE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF THE GUARDS AND A CLOSE
ASSAULT WEAPON OR SHOT GUN SHOULD BE USED TO CLEAR OUT THE HOUSE IN ONE FELL SWOOP. YOU SHOULD ONLY NEED ONE OR TWO AGENTS FOR 
THIS ONE ALTHOUGH A THIRD COULD COME IN HANDY WHEN KEEPING THE POLICE AT BAY WHILST THE OTHERS GET ON WITH THE GUARDS.
