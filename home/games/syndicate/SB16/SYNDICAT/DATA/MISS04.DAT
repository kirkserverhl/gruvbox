GRAND OPENING.

ASSASSINATION.

A MEMBER OF THE CIVIC COUNCIL THAT USED TO BE ON OUR PAYROLL IS OPENING A SHOPPING CENTRE SOON. HE WAS QUITE WELL TRUSTED AND
HAD ACCESS TO SOME INFORMATION THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS AND EMBARRASSING.

HE MUST BE ASSASSINATED BEFORE HE HAS A CHANCE TO DIVULGE THIS INFORMATION TO ANYBODY.

|
CITY UPDATE:

THERE IS A CANAL WHICH SPLITS THE CITY IN TWO. THE SHOPPING CENTRE IS ON THE NORTH BANK. AS THERE ARE ONLY A FEW CROSSING PLACES
YOUR FIRST OBJECTIVE IS TO SECURE A CROSSING POINT.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

REPORTS SHOW AN INTEREST FROM AT LEAST THREE ENEMY SYNDICATES ALL AFTER THE INFORMATION THAT THE COUNCILLOR HOLDS. IT IS ALSO
POSSIBLE THAT HE HAS HIRED HIS OWN BODYGUARDS TO LOOK AFTER HIM.

|
TACTICS:

SECURE THE NEAREST BRIDGE BEFORE CROSSING TO THE NORTH BANK. UZIS SHOULD TAKE CARE OF MOST ENEMY AGENTS BUT IF THERE ARE ANY
BODYGUARDS IT WOULD BE WISE TO EMPLOY LONG RANGE WEAPONRY AGAINST THEM.
