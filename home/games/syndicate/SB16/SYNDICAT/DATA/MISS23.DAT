OLD MACDONALD.

RAID AND RESCUE.

ONE OF OUR CORPORATE FRIENDS HAS JUST HAD HIS FARM TAKEN OVER BY THE MILITARY. THEY SEEM TO BE USING IT AS A FORWARD OBSERVATION
POST AS PART OF THEIR OPERATIONS IN THIS AREA.

WE BELIEVE A MILITARY STRIKE IS PLANNED SOON AND IT WILL BE COORDINATED FROM THE FARMHOUSE.

OUR FRIEND AND HIS WIFE ARE BEING HELD AGAINST THEIR WILL IN ONE OF THE OUT HOUSES. YOUR TEAM IS TO DISRUPT THE ENEMY ACTIVITY
WHILST AT THE SAME TIME RESCUING OUR FRIEND AND HIS WIFE. YOU WILL NEED TO <PERSUADE> BOTH OF THEM.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

AS IT IS A MILITARY OPERATION YOU CAN EXPECT A WELL PLANNED DEFENCE WITH PLENTY OF BACKUP. THEY WILL PROBABLY BE EQUIPPED WITH
LIGHT AUTOMATICS BUT WILL NO DOUBT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF HEAVIER GUNS.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THEIR MAIN COMMUNICATIONS BUNDLE IS HOUSED IN THE REAR OF AN A.P.C. WHICH IS PARKED IN THE COURTYARD. YOU MUST DESTROY THE A.P.C.
TO SUCCESSFULLY DISRUPT THEIR COMMS NETWORK.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THE PRISONERS ARE KEPT IN ONE OF THE OUT HOUSES. AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS LOCATED TO THE SOUTH OF THE MAIN 
COMPLEX. THEY ARE BELIEVED TO BE UNDER GUARD AND VERY FRIGHTENED. THEY MAY NEED <PERSUADING> TO LEAVE THE AREA.

|
TACTICS:

THE SQUAD SHOULD BE SPLIT IN TWO FOR THIS MISSION. ONE SECTION SHOULD PROCEED TO THE COURTYARD. ONCE THERE THE APC SHOULD BE 
DESTROYED WITH ANTI TANK WEAPONRY AND ANY GUARDS SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF WITH AUTOMATICS OR ASSAULT WEAPONS. BY THIS TIME THE
SECOND SECTION SHOULD HAVE REACHED THE OUT HOUSE AND AS SOON AS THE A.P.C. IS DESTROYED THE OUT HOUSE GUARDS SHOULD BE KILLED AND
THE PRISONERS RESCUED.

WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ALSO A GROUND CAR ON THE PREMISES. THIS WOULD BE A VALUABLE AID TO THE ESCAPE.
