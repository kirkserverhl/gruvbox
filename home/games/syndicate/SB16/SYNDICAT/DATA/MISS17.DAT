ASSAULT THE FORTRESS.

ASSAULT.

THE MILITARY HAS CONSTRUCTED A SMALL FORTRESS CLOSE TO ONE OF OUR PRODUCTION PLANTS. REPORTS INDICATE THAT AN ENEMY SYNDICATE
IS ALSO USING IT AS A STOP OFF POINT FOR RAIDS INTO THE PLANT.

AN ASSAULT FORCE IS BEING DISPATCHED TO DESTROY THE FORTRESS.

YOUR ASSAULT SQUAD IS TO LAUNCH A PRELIMINARY ATTACK AND TAKE OUT MUCH OF THE DEFENCES AS POSSIBLE BEFORE WITHDRAWING TO ALLOW
THE MAIN STRIKE FORCE TO ATTACK.

THE PRIMARY TARGET IS THE BASE COMMANDER WHO MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE BASE. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THERE ARE TWO ARMOURED
PERSONNEL CARRIERS IN THE COMPLEX AND THESE MUST ALSO BE DESTROYED. FINALLY THERE IS A MEDICAL RESCUE VEHICLE WITH SOME VERY
INTERESTING EQUIPMENT ON BOARD. YOU MUST STEAL THIS AND RETURN TO THE DROP ZONE FOR RETRIEVAL.

TRANSPORT HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR THIS MISSION.

CITY UPDATE:

THERE ARE TWO ENTRANCES TO THE FORTRESS. THE MAIN GATE IS QUITE WELL DEFENDED AND IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE BY CAR. THERE IS ALSO
BELIEVED TO BE A SIDE ENTRANCE LEADING TO THE ROOF AREA. THIS IS VERY HEAVILY GUARDED AS MOST OF THE GUARDS ARE ON THE ROOF.

|
TACTICS:

A FRONTAL ATTACK USING THE VEHICLE PROVIDED TO GET THROUGH THE BLAST DOORS WOULD GET YOU INTO THE BASE WITH THE MINIMUM OF
FUSS AND EXPOSURE. ALL AGENTS SHOULD BE DEPLOYED AND EQUIPPED WITH CLOSE AND AREA OF EFFECT WEAPONS. AT LEAST ONE SHOULD CARRY
SOME SUPPORT FIREPOWER AND EXPLOSIVES FOR DEALING WITH THE A.P.CS. THE AMBULANCE IS YOUR BEST BET FOR ESCAPING SO DO NOT DESTROY
IT WITH THE A.P.CS.
