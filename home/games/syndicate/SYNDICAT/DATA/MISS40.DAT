REDS RUN.

ESCORT.

ONE OF OUR UNDERCOVER AGENTS HAS HAD HER COVER BLOWN BY A MOLE IN THE DEPARTMENT. AT THIS TIME SHE IS IN A NEARBY CITY AND
SEVERAL ENEMY SYNDICATE ACQUISITION SQUADS HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED TO RETRIEVE HER. THEY MUST NOT GET THEIR HANDS ON HER AS SHE
HAS HAD ACCESS TO SOME CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

YOUR SQUAD WILL BE DROPPED NEARBY AND YOU MUST ESCORT HER TO THE RENDEZVOUS POINT.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

AT THE LAST COUNT OUR SCANNERS SHOWED THREE DROP SHIPS HEADING TOWARDS THE CITY. PREVIOUS INFORMATION LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT
EACH SHIP CARRIES FOUR AGENTS FOR A TOTAL OF TWELVE ENEMY AGENTS IN THE CITY.

|
TACTICS:

KEEP THE ENEMY PINNED AT LONG RANGE. DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO GET CLOSE OTHERWISE A STRAY SHOT COULD HIT OUR AGENT. SHE IS VERY
RESOURCEFUL AND WILL FIND HER OWN WAY OUT BUT SHE NEEDS A FIRE SUPPORT TEAM TO KEEP THE ENEMY OFF HER BACK. TWO OR THREE AGENTS
SHOULD BE DEPLOYED WITH LIGHT AUTOMATICS AND LONG RANGE WEAPONS. SUPPORT AND AREA OF EFFECT WEAPONS SHOULD NOT BE USED AS THESE
TOO COULD ENDANGER OUR AGENT.
