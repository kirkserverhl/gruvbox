THE RUNNER.

ASSASSINATION.

A MILITARY ADVISER TO AN ENEMY SYNDICATE IS HOLED UP IN A BUNKER IN THE CITY. HE IS A VALUED ASSET TO THE ENEMY BUT WOULDNT
BE MUCH USE TO US AND SO HE MUST BE TERMINATED.

THE ENEMY SYNDICATE HAS SEEN FIT TO DEPLOY A NUMBER OF DEFENCE SQUADS IN THE CITY SO YOUR STRIKE TEAM WILL BE DEPLOYED
JUST OUTSIDE THE AREA CLOSE TO A TRANSPORT SYSTEM.

YOU MUST INFILTRATE THE BUNKER AND ASSASSINATE THE TARGET BEFORE HE CAN LEAVE.

|
CITY UPDATE:

THE CITY ITSELF IS RAISED ABOVE THE VEGETATION LEVEL ON A SERIES OF SUPPORTS. THERE ARE ONLY A FEW ACCESS WAYS TO THE LOWER
LEVEL SO ANYBODY FALLING OFF THE MAIN LEVEL WILL HAVE A HARD TIME TRYING TO GET BACK UP AGAIN.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THE BUNKER ITSELF IS ACCESSIBLE BY VEHICLE OR A LONG TUNNEL. AS WE CANNOT PROVIDE A VEHICLE FOR THIS MISSION YOUR SQUAD WILL
HAVE TO PROCEED ON FOOT TO THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE. WE BELIEVE THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL IS LOCATED NEAR THE DOCKS AREA TO THE
SOUTH OF THE CITY.

|
TACTICS:

THE ADVISER ISNT STUPID AND IF HE SEES YOU COMING HE WILL EITHER MOBILISE FURTHER ENEMY INTERCEPT SQUADS OR ATTEMPT TO GET AWAY.
YOU SHOULD POST A GUARD AT THE REAR ENTRANCE IN CASE HE TRIES TO MAKE A BREAK FOR IT.
