DRAGONS BREATH.

COMBAT SWEEP.

OUR INTELLIGENCE REPORTS LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT AN ENEMY SYNDICATE IS ABOUT TO TEST ITS PROTOTYPE NEW WEAPON ON THE UNSUSPECTING
POPULACE OF A NEARBY SETTLEMENT.

YOUR SQUAD WILL BE DEPLOYED TO ENSURE THAT THE TEST FIRING DOES NOT GO AS PLANNED AND ALSO TO STEAL ANYTHING THAT YOU THINK IS OF
ANY INTEREST TO OUR RESEARCH AND DESIGN BOYS.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

FOUR ENEMY SQUADS HAVE ALL BEEN DEPLOYED AND THEY ARE ALL EQUIPPED WITH THIS NEW WEAPON. THE WEAPON ITSELF IS REPORTED TO BE
SOME FORM OF FLAMETHROWER.

|
TACTICS:

WE HAVE LEARNED THAT WHILE THE FLAMETHROWER IS LETHAL UP CLOSE ITS RANGE IS SADLY LACKING. YOUR BEST BET IS TO KEEP THE ENEMY
PINNED WITH THE USE OF LONG OR MEDIUM RANGE AUTOMATICS. EVEN SO THE FULL SQUAD SHOULD BE DEPLOYED DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF ENEMY
PRESENT.
