CHEM CORP PLANT.

PERSONNEL ACQUISITION.

DOCTOR CAULDWELL HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN THE FIELD OF CHEMICAL WARFARE AND WOULD THEREFORE BE AN IMMENSE ASSET TO THE
COMPANY. HOWEVER HIS CURRENT WORKPLACE HAS COME UNDER SCRUTINY FROM ENEMY SYNDICATES WHO ARE ANXIOUS TO GRAB HIM FOR THEIR
OWN NEEDS. OBVIOUSLY WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN.

YOUR MISSION IS TO <PERSUADE> THE GOOD DOCTOR TO MOVE OFFICES.

|
CITY UPDATE:

THE CHEMICAL PLANT THAT THE DOCTOR IS WORKING AT IS LOCATED IN THE SOUTHEASTERN CORNER OF THE CITY.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE DOCTOR HAS BEEN AWARE OF A LOT OF SYNDICATE ACTIVITY AND INTEREST FOR A LONG TIME. IT IS THEREFORE
REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT HE WILL HAVE HIRED BODYGUARDS. IF THIS IS THE CASE THEN YOU CAN EXPECT THE COMPLEX TO BE WELL DEFENDED.

|
TACTICS:

DUE TO THE PROXIMITY AND AGGRESSION OF ENEMY SYNDICATES YOU WOULD BE WELL ADVISED TO DEPLOY A FULL SQUAD WITH AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
IF THE CHEMICAL PLANT IS DEFENDED THEN LONG RANGE WEAPONRY SHOULD BE USED TO ACCURATELY PICK OFF ANY GUARDS THAT HAPPEN TO BE
AROUND WITHOUT ENDANGERING THE DOCTOR.
