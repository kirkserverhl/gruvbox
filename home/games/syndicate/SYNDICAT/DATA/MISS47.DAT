PICK AND CHOOSE.

SABOTAGE.

AN ENEMY CONVOY IS STOPPING OFF FOR SUPPLIES NEARBY. ONE OF THE APCS CONTAINS POTENTIAL AGENTS BEFORE THEIR OUTFITTING PROCESS
AND THE OTHER CONTAINS DOCUMENTS AND SURVEILANCE REPORTS.

YOUR SQUAD IS TO BREAK INTO THE COMPOUND WHERE THE VEHICLES ARE AND DESTROY THE TROOP TRANSPORT. ONCE THIS IS DONE THEN STEAL THE
SURVEILLANCE APC AND RETURN TO THE PICKUP POINT.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

THE ENEMY WHO OWNS THE APCS IS NOT GOING TO BE IMPRESSED WHEN HE FINDS OUT THAT YOU ARE ABOUT. EXPECT SEVERAL DEFENCE SQUADS TO
BE IN THE AREA.

|
TACTICS:

ONE AGENT IS ENOUGH TO INFILTRATE THE COMPLEX AND DESTROY THE TARGET. AS LONG AS YOU GET THE CORRECT VEHICLE THEN YOU SHOULD
BE FINE. EITHER SUPPORT WEAPONRY OR CLOSE ASSAULT FLAMETHROWERS SHOULD BE USED. EXPLOSIVES IF AVAILABLE WOULD ALSO BE VERY
HANDY.
