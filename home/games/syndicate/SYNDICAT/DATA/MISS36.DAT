BEHIND THE WALL.

ASSASSINATION.

ONE OF OUR EARLY MODEL AGENTS HAS TURNED RENEGADE AFTER TOO MUCH ADRENALINE ABUSE. SHE HAS BEEN PICKED UP BY THE POLICE FORCE
AND IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING INTERROGATION IN A SAFE HOUSE.

AS SHE USED TO WORK FOR US SHE HAS VITAL INFORMATION ON OUR TACTICS AND WEAPONS RESEARCH PROGRAMS. OBVIOUSLY THIS WOULD BE
DISASTROUS. SHE MUST BE TERMINATED BEFORE SHE IS ABLE TO DIVULGE THIS INFORMATION.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THE SAFE HOUSE IS LOCATED IN THE MIDDLE SECTOR OF THE CITY. OUR PRELIMINARY SCOUT REPORTS SHOW THAT IT IS FLANKED BY TWO LARGER
BUILDINGS AND THAT THE ONLY WAY INTO THE ENTRANCE COURTYARD IS BY TRAVELING OVER THE ROOFTOPS AND DOWN THE ACCESS RAMP.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

AS A CAPTURED SYNDICATE AGENT IS NOT AN EVERYDAY HAPPENING YOU CAN EXPECT THERE TO BE SEVERAL WELL EQUIPPED GUARDS STATIONED
AROUND THE TARGET. EVEN SO THEY SHOULD STILL BE NO MATCH FOR A WELL EQUIPPED ASSAULT SQUAD.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

WITHOUT ANY DOUBT THIS AGENT WILL ALSO BE OF GREAT VALUE TO ENEMY SYNDICATES AND YOU CAN EXPECT SEVERAL ENEMY SQUADS TO BE
ACTIVE IN THE SURROUNDING AREA. THEY MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO GET THEIR HANDS ON THE TARGET. YOU MUST NOT ALLOW THEM CLOSE
ENOUGH TO <PERSUADE> THE TARGET AS THEY WILL THEN HAVE ACCESS TO HER HIGHER MEMORY FUNCTIONS.

|
TACTICS:

A SMALL SQUAD OF ONE OR TWO AGENTS SHOULD PROCEED WITH ALL HASTE TO THE SAFE HOUSE AND SECURE THE ROOF TOPS. WHEN THIS IS
ACHIEVED THEN ANOTHER AGENT CAN ENTER THE COURTYARD AND SAFE HOUSE TO CARRY OUT THE MISSION. THE OTHER TWO AGENTS SHOULD PROVIDE
COVER FIRE WHERE NECESSARY AND ABOVE ALL PREVENT THE ENEMY SYNDICATE SQUADS FROM REACHING THE HOUSE. LONG RANGE WEAPONRY SHOULD
BE EMPLOYED BY THE ROOFTOP DEFENDERS AND LIGHT AUTOMATICS SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THE GUARDS AND TARGET.
