WALK ON THE WILD SIDE.

COMBAT SWEEP.

THE LOCAL POPULACE IS BEING TERRORISED BY SEVERAL RAMPAGING ENEMY SYNDICATES. AS THIS TOWN IS ON OUR EXPANSION LIST WE HAVE
DECIDED TO STEP IN AND OFFER OUR SUPPORT.

YOUR SQUAD WILL CONDUCT A SWEEP TO REMOVE ALL ENEMY SYNDICATE ACTIVITY FROM THE AREA.

|
TACTICS:

KEEP YOUR SQUAD TIGHT AND PERFORM THE SWEEP IN A METHODICAL FASHION. LIGHT AUTOMATICS SHOULD MAKE SHORT WORK OF ENEMY AGENTS
BUT THE OCCASIONAL LONG RANGE OR SUPPORT WEAPON COULD BE EMPLOYED FOR COVER FIRE.
