THE POLICEMANS BALL.

PERSONNEL ACQUISITION.

THE CAPTAIN OF THE LOCAL POLICE FORCE IS PLANNING TO RETIRE AFTER A LONG AND GLORIOUS CAREER IN WHICH HE RARELY STRAYED FROM THE
PATH OF JUSTICE UNLESS WE ASKED HIM TO. HIS REPLACEMENT IS REPUTED TO BE IN THE POCKET OF ANOTHER SYNDICATE AND WILL OBVIOUSLY
NOT BE AS HELPFUL.

YOUR SQUAD IS TO <PERSUADE> THE NEW CAPTAIN AND BRING HIM BACK TO THE LANDING ZONE SO HE CAN BE TAKEN TO HEADQUARTERS FOR A CHAT.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

THE ENEMY SYNDICATE HAS GOTTEN WIND OF THIS PLAN AND HAS DESPATCHED A DEFENCE SQUAD FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE CAPTAIN.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THE TARGET IS IN THE COMPLEX IN THE NORTHWEST SECTOR OF THE CITY. HE MAY BE CONSIDERABLY HARDER TO <PERSUADE> THAN A NORMAL
CIVILIAN DUE TO HIS POLICE BACKGROUND. WE ALSO BELIEVE HIM TO BE ARMED.

|
TACTICS:

ONE OR TWO AGENTS WITH LIGHT AUTOMATICS AND AT LEAST ONE PERSUADERTRON SHOULD HAVE NO TROUBLE WITH THE CAPTAIN. THE ENEMY SQUAD
SHOULD TAKE MORE CONSIDERATION. IF YOU DEPLOY A FEW AGENTS THEN KEEP THEM TOGETHER FOR THE BEST DEFENCE AND LET THEM WATCH
EACH OTHERS BACKS. IF YOU DEPLOY A LARGER AMOUNT THEN TRY TO LURE THE ENEMY SQUAD INTO AN AMBUSH SITUATION. DO NOT ENGAGE
ANYBODY NEAR THE TARGET ZONE AS THIS MAY ENDANGER THE TARGET.
