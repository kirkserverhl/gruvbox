THE BIG BLACK.

COMBAT SWEEP.

THE ATLANTIC OCEAN AFTER DECADES OF MISUSE HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST POLLUTED SEAS OF THE WORLD. THE SEA BED WHILE STILL BEING
MINERAL RICH IS RAPIDLY DECLINING AND WITH THE WORLD WATER AND ENERGY SHORTAGES GROWING MORE AND MORE SEVERE THERE ARE AN 
INCREASING NUMBER OF SYNDICATES AND COUNTRIES LOOKING TO THE SEA FOR ANSWERS.

THE ATLANTIC ACCELERATOR IS A HUGE WATER AND MINERAL RESEARCH STATION THAT FLOATS ON THE POLLUTED SURFACE. SCIENCE PROBES AND
EXPLORATION CRAFT ARE LOWERED INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS FOR RESEARCH IN A VAIN ATTEMPT TO SOLVE THE WORLDS WATER AND ENERGY PROBLEMS.

OUR INTELLIGENCE SHOWS THAT THE SCIENTISTS ON BOARD ARE EXTREMELY CLOSE TO MAKING THE GREAT DISCOVERY WHICH MAY SAVE THE PLANET.

THE SYNDICATE THAT HAS THIS DISCOVERY CAN SURELY RULE THE WHOLE WORLD.

YOUR SQUAD HAS BEEN AIRLIFTED TO THE ACCELERATOR AND YOUR MISSION IS TO SWEEP ALL OTHER ENEMY AGENTS FROM THE PLATFORM TO CLAIM
THIS STATION FOR OUR ADVANCEMENT AND CONQUEST.

SYNDICATE UPDATE:

THE ENEMY SYNDICATES HAVE REALISED THAT WE ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO THEIR SURVIVAL AND AS SUCH HAVE BONDED TOGETHER
IN AN AWESOME ALLIANCE OF RESOURCE AND MANPOWER. THE STRIKE AND ASSAULT TEAMS OF SEVEN OTHER SYNDICATES HAVE ALSO BEEN DEPLOYED
ON THE STATION BUT INSTEAD OF FIGHTING AMONGST THEMSELVES THEY ARE ACTING TOGETHER AS A TEAM. THEIR WEAPONRY RESERVES AND
TECHNOLOGY HAVE BEEN POOLED TO EQUIP THIS FEARSOME FIGHTING MACHINE.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

YOU ARE TOTALLY OUTGUNNED AND OUTNUMBERED ON THIS ONE. IN ADDITION TO THE ENEMY SYNDICATE SQUADS THERE ARE ALSO THE RESIDENT
GUARD POSTS MANNED BY THE EFFICIENT AND WELL EQUIPPED SECURITY FORCES. THEY TOO REALISE THE MAJOR THREAT THAT WE POSE TO
THEM AND SO EXPECT THEM TO SIDE WITH THE ENEMY SYNDICATE COALITION. WE BELIEVE THAT GAUSS GUNS AND MINI GUNS ARE THE STANDARD
GUARD POST EQUIPMENT.

|
TACTICS:

THE WHOLE SQUAD MUST BE DEPLOYED FOR THIS ONE. ALL TEAM MEMBERS WILL HAVE TO BE MODIFIED TO STAND A CHANCE. AS YOU ARE
COMPLETELY OUTNUMBERED TRY TO LURE THE ENEMY AGENTS AND GUARDS INTO AMBUSH SITUATIONS WHERE YOU CAN DIRECT MAXIMUM FIREPOWER
TOWARDS SMALLER GROUPS. KEEP ON THE MOVE AS EVENTUALLY THEY WILL OVERWHELM YOUR POSITION IF YOU DIG IN.

AT LEAST TWO TEAM MEMBERS SHOULD CARRY HEAVY OR SUPPORT WEAPONRY AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR ARMS MUST BE MODIFIED TO ALLOW THEM
TO OPERATE EFFICIENTLY. DO NOT ALLOW YOUR SQUAD TO GET SPLIT UP OTHERWISE THERE IS A DANGER OF THEM BECOMING CUT OFF AND WIPED
OUT. MEDIKITS AND ENERGY SHIELDS SHOULD BE CARRIED AS STANDARD.

DUE TO THE NUMBER OF THE ENEMY AMMUNITION LEVELS MAY BECOME STRAINED. TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO REPLENISH WEAPON SUPPLIES FROM
FALLEN COMRADES OR ENEMY.

ABOVE ALL KEEP IT TIGHT PEOPLE AND WATCH EACH OTHERS BACKS.

GOOD LUCK...
