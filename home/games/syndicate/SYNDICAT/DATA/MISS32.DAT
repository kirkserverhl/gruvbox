CONVOY.

ASSASSINATION.

A DISTINGUISHED GOVERNMENT MINISTER IS PREPARING TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE THAT HE HAS SOME CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
ABOUT US THAT COULD PROVE DANGEROUS AS WELL AS EMBARRASSING.

HE IS BEING ESCORTED FROM THE STATION TO THE HELIPORT IN AN ARMED CONVOY.

YOUR AGENTS ARE TO INTERCEPT THIS CONVOY AND KILL HIM BEFORE HE CAN REACH THE HELIPORT.

|
SECURITY UPDATE:

THE WHOLE ROUTE IS LINED WITH POLICE OFFICERS AS WELL AS CIVVIES. THEY ARE ALL ARMED AND READY FOR TROUBLE.

THE MAIN PART OF THE CONVOY CONSISTS OF TWO APCS AND THE POLICE CAR IN WHICH THE TARGET IS RIDING.

|
TACTICS:

A SINGLE AGENT WOULD STAND JUST AS MUCH OF A CHANCE AS SEVERAL. THE HARD HITTING APPROACH INVOLVES HOT FOOTING IT OVER TO
THE CONVOY ROUTE AND DESTROYING THE POLICE CAR WITH HEAVY WEAPONS. A MORE SUBTLE BUT RISKY MANOEUVRE WOULD BE TO STEAL A
CAR AND FOLLOW THE CONVOY. WHEN THE TARGET LEAVES HIS CAR AND STARTS TOWARDS THE HELIPORT THEN OPEN UP WITH A BURST OF
AUTOMATIC FIRE. TIMING IS EVERYTHING ON THIS ONE.
