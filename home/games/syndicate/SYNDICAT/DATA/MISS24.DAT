SNIPER.

ASSASSINATION.

THE WEALTHY WIDOW OF AN ENEMY SYNDICATE EXECUTIVE HAS BOUGHT CONTROL OF A SMALL CITY NEAR HERE. SHE HAS SET UP HER HOME ON A SMALL
ISLAND IN THE WEST OF THE CITY AND SHE HAS ALSO PROVIDED SOME SERIOUS FINANCIAL AID TO THE POLICE FORCE.

CONSEQUENTLY OUR UNDERGROUND CONNECTIONS IN THE CITY HAVE BEEN JEOPARDISED BY THIS INFLUX OF AUTHORITY AND WE ARE HAVING PROBLEMS
INTERCEPTING ENEMY SYNDICATE INFORMATION.

YOUR SQUAD IS TO ASSASSINATE THE DEAR LADY AS QUICKLY AND QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

THE LAST MESSAGE THAT WE GOT BEFORE OUR LINKS WERE CUT WAS THAT AN ENEMY SYNDICATE ASSAULT SQUAD WAS ON ITS WAY TO ENSURE THAT
THE WIDOW MANAGED THE CITY EFFECTIVELY. SINCE THEN WE BELIEVE THAT ANOTHER SQUAD HAS BEEN DEPLOYED AS A BODYGUARD. THIS
INFORMATION IS NOT ENTIRELY RELIABLE.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THERE IS NO MEANS OF GETTING ON TO THE TARGETS PRIVATE ISLAND ON FOOT AND HER TEAM OF GUARDS PATROL THE PERIMETER TWENTY FOUR
HOURS A DAY.

|
TACTICS:

THE ONLY WAY TO KILL THE TARGET IS BY A LONG RANGE SNIPER SHOT FROM A NEIGHBOURING ROOF TOP. IF DONE PROPERLY SHE WILL BE DEAD
BEFORE THE GUARDS KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING. A SINGLE AGENT WILL ATTRACT CONSIDERABLY LESS ATTENTION THAN A WHOLE SQUAD AND THE
ENEMY SYNDICATES ARE LESS LIKELY TO DETECT YOUR ARRIVAL.
