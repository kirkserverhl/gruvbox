SCUM PATROL.

COMBAT SWEEP.

A NEARBY CITY HAS JUST FALLEN INTO ANARCHY WITH THE UNTIMELY DEATH OF THE MAYOR. EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS NOTHING TO DO WITH US WE
FEEL THAT THE GOOD CITIZENS OF THE CITY REQUIRE OUR SUPPORT AND UNDERSTANDING AT THIS TERRIBLE TIME.

OTHER SYNDICATES ALSO SEEM TO HAVE THE SAME IDEA HOWEVER.

YOUR SQUAD IS TO PERFORM A SWEEP THROUGH THE CITY TO CLEAR OUT ANY OF THE ENEMY SYNDICATE SLIME.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

AT LEAST THREE ENEMY SQUADS HAVE BEEN SIGHTED IN THE AREA. WITH ANY LUCK THEY WILL ALL BE GUNNING FOR EACH OTHER AS WELL SO YOU
WONT HAVE MUCH TO WORRY ABOUT THEM.

|
TACTICS:

LET THEM FIGHT IT OUT AMONGST THEMSELVES. KEEP YOUR SQUAD TOGETHER AND JUST TRY TO AVOID GETTING CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE. BIDE
YOUR TIME AND JUST DEFEND YOURSELVES UNTIL MOST OF THE ENEMY HAS DIED BEFORE MOPPING UP THE REST OF THE OPPOSITION. AUTOMATICS
WITH A FEW LONG RANGE SUPPORT WEAPONS ARE CALLED FOR IN THIS ONE. AS IT COULD BE A LONG MISSION YOU WOULD BE WELL ADVISED
TO TAKE A FEW MEDIKITS AS WELL.
