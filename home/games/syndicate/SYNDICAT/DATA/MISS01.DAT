MERCENARY CAMP.

ASSASSINATION.

INTELLIGENCE REPORTS HAVE INDICATED THAT AN ARMY COLONEL IS STEALING RESOURCES FROM YOUR WEAPONS DIVISION AND USING THEM TO EQUIP
HIS MERCENARIES.

HIS BASE HAS BEEN SET UP JUST OUTSIDE ONE OF OUR CITIES AND THE POPULACE HAVE REPORTED DISTURBANCES CAUSED BY HIS TROOPS.

YOUR SQUAD WILL BE DEPLOYED NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO THE CAMP. THEIR OBJECTIVE IS TO ELIMINATE THE COLONEL.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

SURVEILLANCE REPORTS SHOW THAT THE CAMP IS GUARDED BY ABOUT FIVE MILITIA ARMED WITH BOTH SHOTGUNS AND PISTOLS.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THE COLONEL IS BELIEVED TO STAY IN THE NORTHERN MOST BUILDING OF THE CAMP. IF HE BECOMES AWARE OF YOUR PRESENCE HE MAY DECIDE TO
WITHDRAW. HE MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO ESCAPE.

|
TACTICS:

A SINGLE AGENT COULD INFILTRATE THE CAMP AND ASSASSINATE THE TARGET QUITE EASILY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHILST A SHOTGUN
IS DEVASTATING AS A CLOSE IN WEAPON IT IS SERIOUSLY OUTRANGED BY THE PISTOL AND SO PROVISION SHOULD BE MADE FOR BOTH OF THESE
WEAPONS TO BE USED TO THEIR BEST POTENTIAL. IT IS ALSO ADVISED THAT A SIMILARLY EQUIPPED AGENT BE KEPT OUTSIDE THE CAMP FOR
BACKUP IF NEEDED.
