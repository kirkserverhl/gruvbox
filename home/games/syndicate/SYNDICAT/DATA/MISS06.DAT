BUSINESS INITIATIVE.

ASSASSINATION.

ONE OF OUR FORMER EMPLOYEES HAS TAKEN IT UPON HIMSELF TO LEAVE AND START HIS OWN BUSINESS. HE IS USING TECHNOLOGY STOLEN FROM OUR
LABS TO AID HIS RESEARCH PROGRAM AND OBVIOUSLY HE CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO GET AWAY WITH THIS.

YOUR MISSION IS TO INFILTRATE HIS PREMISES AND TERMINATE HIM WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE.

|
CITY UPDATE:

THE CITY ITSELF HAS A WARREN OF UNDERGROUND PASSAGES AND ACCESS TUNNELS AND IT IS RUMOURED THAT ONE OF THESE TUNNELS LEADS INTO
THE TARGET COMPLEX. IF YOU COULD LOCATE THIS YOU HAVE A NICE AND SNEAKY WAY INTO THE CAMP WITHOUT ATTRACTING THE ATTENTION OF
THE AUTHORITIES.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THE TARGET COMPLEX LIES IN THE SOUTH WESTERN CORNER OF THE CITY JUST OFF THE TRAIN RUN AND WE BELIEVE IT IS GUARDED BY A NUMBER
OF LIGHTLY ARMED GUARDS.

|
TACTICS:

A LONE ASSASSIN STANDS A FAIRLY GOOD CHANCE OF INFILTRATING THE AREA AND ELIMINATING THE TARGET WITH THE MINIMUM OF FUSS BUT IT IS
ALWAYS WISE TO KEEP AND EXTRA COUPLE OF AGENTS AS BACKUP. FOR THE TUNNELS IT IS ADVISABLE TO TAKE WEAPONS SUCH AS SHOTGUNS AS
A LOT OF THE ENCOUNTERS WILL BE VERY CLOSE UP INDEED. IF YOU CHOOSE TO GO THE SURFACE WAY TRY TO MAKE USE OF THE RAIL SYSTEM
TO GET CLOSER TO THE CAMP WITHOUT RUNNING INTO TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE.
