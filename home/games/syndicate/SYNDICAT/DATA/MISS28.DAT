RAMPAGE.

COMBAT PATROL.

THE LATEST POTENTIAL RETAIL AND ADVERTISING OUTLET HAS BEEN OVERRUN BY ENEMY AGENTS.

YOUR SQUAD IS TO LAND IN THE CITY AND REMOVE EVERY LAST TRACE OF THE ENEMY.

|
CITY UPDATE:

THE CITY IS SPLIT IN TWO BY A LARGE EXPANSE OF WATER. AS THERE IS ONLY ONE ROUTE ACROSS THE BRIDGE MUST BE SECURED AS SOON
AS POSSIBLE. AS IT IS A ROAD BRIDGE IT IS INACCESSIBLE TO PEDESTRIANS. SOME FORM OF TRANSPORT WILL BE REQUIRED TO REACH THE
OTHER SIDE.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

THERE ARE AT LEAST FIVE DIFFERENT SYNDICATE SQUADS PRESENT IN THE CITY.

|
TACTICS:

THE FULL SQUAD SHOULD BE USED. KEEP IT TIGHT AND MAXIMISE YOUR FIREPOWER ON INDIVIDUAL TARGETS. AS WE BELIEVE THERE TO BE QUITE
A NUMBER OF ENEMY SQUADS YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF YOUR AMMUNITION LEVEL. BE PREPARED TO STEAL WEAPONRY FROM FALLEN ENEMY AGENTS AND
DONT FORGET TO TAKE PLENTY OF MEDIKITS.
