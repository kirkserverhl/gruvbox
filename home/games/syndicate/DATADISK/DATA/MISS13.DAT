THE ALLEYWAY.

EQUIPMENT AQUISTION.

ONE OF OUR ARMY CONTACTS HAS JUST INFORMED US OF A MAJOR WEAPON PROJECT THAT THE ARMY HAS BEEN WORKING ON.

THE RLX 240 IS AN EXPERIMENTAL PORTABLE ROCKET LAUNCHER AND IT IS BEING DEVELOPED IN A SCIENCE BASE IN THE DESERT. REPORTS SHOW
THAT IT HAS JUST REACHED THE PROTOTYPE STAGE.

NATURALLY OUR TECH BOYS WANT THIS WEAPON AND ITS DOWN TO YOU TO GET IT.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

THE BASE ITSELF CONSISTS OF A LONG ALLEY FROM THE ENTRANCE DOWN TO THE MAIN BUILDING AT THE FAR END. IT IS GUARDED BY SEVERAL 
SECURITY UNITS WITH SOME QUITE HEAVY WEAPONRY. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE BUNKERS WITH HEAVY WEAPON EMPLACEMENTS IN THE
MAIN BUILDING ITSELF. IF THIS IS THE CASE THEN THEY WOULD HAVE AN INCREDIBLE FIELD OF FIRE AND BE ABLE TO TAKE OUT ANYTHING
THAT MOVED DOWN THE MAIN ALLEY.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THE WEAPON ITSELF IS BELIEVED TO BE HOUSED IN A SECURE ROOM ON THE ROOF OF THE FAR BUILDING.

|
TACTICS:

AS RESISTANCE IS GOING TO BE TOUGH YOU SHOULD TAKE IN THE MOST POWERFUL SQUAD YOU CAN MUSTER. YOU WILL BE ATTACKED FROM BOTH SIDES
AS YOU WALK ALONG THE ROAD SO TRY TO STICK TO ONE SIDE. IT MAY BE WORTH WHILE SENDING A LONE AGENT AROUND THE SIDE AND TRY TO 
REACH THE BUILDING THAT WAY. AS NOTHING IS KNOWN ABOUT THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE MAIN BUILDING YOU ARE VERY MUCH ON YOUR
OWN WHEN YOU ENTER IT.
