THE MILK RUN.

PERSONNEL ACQUISITION.

TWO NOTABLE SCIENTISTS ARE BOTH STAYING IN A SMALL HAMLET CLOSE TO ONE OF OUR RESEARCH COMPLEXES. THEY WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE
A GREAT HELP TO OUR R AND D BOYS.

YOUR SQUAD HAS INSTRUCTIONS TO <PERSUADE> BOTH THE SCIENTISTS TO JOIN OUR REPUTABLE ORGANISATION.

|
CITY UPDATE:

THERE IS A SEWER SYSTEM THAT RUNS FROM THE RESEARCH COMPLEX TO THE RIVER AND IT HAS INLETS IN THE HAMLET ITSELF. YOUR SQUAD
WILL BE TRANSPORTED BY SEWER RAFT TO A DROP OFF POINT IN THE TOWN ITSELF. THE SEWERS ARE VERY DANGEROUS HOWEVER AND WITHOUT
THE PROPER EQUIPMENT IT IS INADVISABLE TO ENTER THEM.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

THERE IS A VERY SMALL POLICE PRESENCE IN THE TOWN THAT SHOULD PROVIDE NO PROBLEM AT ALL. THE SCIENTISTS HOWEVER
HAVE BROUGHT ALONG BODYGUARDS. THESE HAVE TO BE ELIMINATED CAREFULLY SO AS NOT TO DAMAGE THE TARGET.

|
TACTICS:

SMALL ARMS ARE ALL THAT IS REALLY NECESSARY FOR THIS MISSION. DO NOT USE SHOTGUNS FOR DEALING WITH THE BODYGUARDS OR ANYONE
WHO HAPPENS TO BE CLOSE TO THE TARGET. ONLY ONE AGENT IS REQUIRED ALTHOUGH YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE IN ANOTHER AS BACKUP.
