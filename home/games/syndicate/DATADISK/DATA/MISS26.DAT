POLICE STORY.

ASSASSINATION.

OUR OPERATIONS IN A NEARBY CITY HAVE BEEN SEVERELY HAMPERED BY THE
ACTIONS OF A SINGLE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. HE HAS RECENTLY COME
ACROSS SOME POTENTIALLY DAMAGING INFORMATION AND EVEN NOW HE IS ON
HIS WAY BACK TO HEADQUARTERS.

WE ARE JAMMING THE TRANSMISSIONS FROM HIS CAR BUT IT IS ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME BEFORE HE GETS OUT OF RANGE.

YOUR SQUAD IS TO ASSASSINATE HIM BEFORE HE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH
HEADQUARTERS.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

THERE ARE ONLY A FEW ENEMY AGENTS OPERATING IN THE AREA ALTHOUGH WE
BELIEVE THEM TO BE QUITE WELL EQUIPPED.

|
TACTICS:

BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR MILITARY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN THE
LOCAL POPULACE. CLEAR THE CROWDS WITH AREA EFFECT WEAPONS AND TRY TO
GET TO THE TARGET VEHICLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
