THERE GOES THE CAVALRY.

COMBAT STRIKE.

THE MILITARY FORCES HAVE BEEN GATHERING FOR A MAJOR ASSAULT ON ONE OF
OUR MANUFACTURING STATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE AIDED BY
SYNDICATE FORCES AND FINANCES.

THEIR MAIN FORCE IS AN ARMOURED INFANTRY UNIT STATIONED IN THE NEARBY
CITY. YOUR SQUAD IS TO RENDER THIS UNIT INOPERABLE.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

AS THE MILITARY ARE PREPARING FOR A CONFLICT YOU CAN EXPECT TO
ENCOUNTER SOME VERY HEAVY RESISTANCE FROM BOTH GROUND AND AIR BASED
TROOPS.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

AT LEAST SIX ENEMY TACTICAL SQUADS HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED TO AID THE
MILITARY WAR MACHINE. YOU WILL BE DROPPED IN TO A HOT ZONE AS THEY
WILL NO DOUBT DETECT OUR DROPSHIPS ALMOST INSTANTLY.

|
TACTICS:

AS SOON AS YOU LAND GET READY FOR SOME FIREWORKS. TRY TO LEAVE THE
DROP ZONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AS THE DROPSHIPS WILL ATTRACT FAR TOO
MUCH ATTENTION.
