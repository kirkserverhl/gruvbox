MULTIPLE ASSASSINATION.

FOUR ENEMY SPIES HAVE RETREATED TO A NEARBY CITY TO ESCAPE OUR
RETALIATION FOR THEIR THEFT OF INFORMATION. THEY OBVIOUSLY BELIEVE
THAT THE OTHER SYNDICATES WILL BE WILLING ENOUGH TO INTERVENE ON
THEIR BEHALF IN EXCHANGE FOR THE INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE.

YOUR SQUAD IS TO ASSASSINATE ALL FOUR SPIES BEFORE THEY CAN PASS ON
THIS INFORMATION.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THE TARGETS RAPIDLY VANISHED INTO THE CITY BUT WE HAVE MANAGED TO
PINPOINT ONE OF THEM. HE WILL BE MARKED AS USUAL. WHEN THE OTHERS
HAVE BEEN LOCATED YOU WILL BE INFORMED.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

THE ENEMY SYNDICATES HAVE SEEN FIT TO GET INVOLVED AND OUR LATEST
INTELLIGENCE REPORTS SEEM TO INDICATE SOME VERY HEAVY WEAPONRY BEING
MOBILISED.

|
TACTICS:

KEEP ON THE MOVE AND TRY NOT TO GET PINNED DOWN BY HEAVY WEAPON FIRE.
AVOID OPEN SPACES AND KEEP DUCKING INTO AND BEHIND BUILDINGS TO AVOID
LONG RANGE ATTACKS.
