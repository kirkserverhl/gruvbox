GRID RUIN.

DATA AQUISITION.

AN ENEMY SYNDICATE HAS SET UP A FORWARD OBSEVATION BUNKER NEARBY. OUR
AIR FORCES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PENETRATE THEIR DEFENCE GRID AND SO WE
ARE POWERLESS AGAINST THEM.

ONE OF OUR DEEP COVER AGENTS MANAGED TO INFILTRATE THE BASE AND
AQUIRE DETAILS OF THE GRID CONFIGURATION. THESE DETAILS WERE PRINTED
ON A CLONE SHIELD TO BE RETURNED TO US.

OUR AGENT HOWEVER WAS DISCOVERED AND MANAGED TO MAKE IT TO THE CITY
BEFORE BEING KILLED. WE BELIEVE SOMEBODY IN THE CITY KNOWS WHERE HE
IS AND CONSEQUENTLY WHERE THE CARD IS.

<PERSUADE> THAT PERSON TO GET THE LOCATION OF THE CARD THEN BRING BOTH BACK
TO BASE.

|
CITY UPDATE:

SINCE THE ASSASSINATION OF THE GOVERNESS THE SECURITY AND LAW
ENFORCEMENT FORCES IN THE CITY HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. EXPECT
STIFF RESISTANCE IF YOU START ANY TROUBLE.

|
TACTICS:

LOCATE THE INFORMANT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BEFORE PROCEEDING TO THE
CARD. AVOID THE ISLAND AS IT IS EVEN MORE DEFENDED THAN BEFORE.
