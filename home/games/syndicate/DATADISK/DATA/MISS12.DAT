ASSASSINATION.

ONE OF OUR POLITICIAN FRIENDS HAS STARTED TO REFUSE US OUR NORMAL AND COURTEOUS REQUESTS. THIS IS EXTREMELY BAD FORM AND IS JUST
NOT TOLERABLE.

IN ORDER TO RESTORE THE STATUS QUO AND MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF HIM WE HAVE DECIDED TO KILL HIS GOOD LADY WIFE.

YOUR SQUAD WILL BE DEPLOYED IN THE DOCKS OF A FLOATING CITY WHERE IT IS BELIEVED SHE SPENDS MOST OF HER TIME. WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE
TO FIND HER LOCATION BUT WE DO KNOW THE WHEREABOUTS OF A LIKELY INFORMER. HE MAY REQUIRE SOME <PERSUASION> TO REVEAL HER LOCATION
HOWEVER.

DEFENCE UPDATE:

THE LOCAL POLICE FORCE IS ALL THAT REALLY STANDS BETWEEN YOU AND THE MISSION OBJECTIVE. THEY ARE POORLY EQUIPPED AND BADLY
TRAINED SO THEY SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

THERE IS NO REASON TO EXPECT ANY ENEMY SYNDICATE FORCES AS THIS DOESNT HAVE ANY DIRECT INFLUENCE ON THEIR BUSINESS. NEVERTHELESS
YOU SHOULD STILL KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR ANY ENEMY SCOUT SQUADS IN THE AREA.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE TARGET HAS BODYGUARDS. NO FURTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON THEM HOWEVER.

|
TACTICS:

A SINGLE ASSASSIN COULD WALK RIGHT UP TO THE HOUSE ALMOST UNDETECTED BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. WHEN YOU ARRIVE AT THE HOUSE
PICK YOUR TIME WELL BEFORE STRIKING. IF THE BUILDING IS GUARDED IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE TO WAIT FOR THE TARGET TO LEAVE AND
PICK HER OFF WITH A LONG RANGE SHOT.
