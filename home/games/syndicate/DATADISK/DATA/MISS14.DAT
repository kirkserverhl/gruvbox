ALL QUIET.

RECON SWEEP.

ENEMY SYNDICATES HAVE BEEN STARTING TO SHOW A GREAT INTEREST IN THIS
CITY. YOUR SQUAD IS TO CONDUCT A PATROL TO WATCH FOR ENEMY AGENTS.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

AT LEAST SIX OTHER ORGANISATIONS HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST. WE HAVE
NO IDEA OF HOW MANY WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH EVENTUALLY.

|
TACTICS:

A ROUTINE GROUP PATTERN COUPLED WITH AN ORGANISED SWEEP PATTERN WILL
SEE THIS MISSION BEING OVER IN NO TIME AT ALL.

|
EMERGENCY UPDATE:

ENEMY DROP SHIPS HAVE BEEN TRACKED IN THE AREA. AN UNKNOWN BUT LARGE
ENEMY FORCE IS HEADING TOWARDS THE CITY. EVACUATE ALL FRIENDLY
OPERATIVES IN THE AREA.
