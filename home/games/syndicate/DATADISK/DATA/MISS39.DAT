ONE OF OUR TOP EXECUTIVES HAS FALLEN FOUL OF AN ENEMY HITMAN. DESPITE
OUR INTENSE SECURITY FORCES THE HITMAN MANAGED TO DO HIS JOB AND THEN
ESCAPE.

HIS LOCATION HAS NOW BEEN FOUND AND YOUR SQUAD ARE TO TEACH HIM THE

TARGET UPDATE:

THE TARGET IS HIDING OUT IN THE EASTERN SECTOR OF A NEARBY CITY. WE
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO REACH THE EASTERN SECTOR AND IT
IS HEAVILY GUARDED.

THE ENEMY SYNDICATE IS ANXIOUS TO KEEP ITS TOP ASSASSIN A GOING
CONCERN AND SO SEVERAL TACTICAL SQUADS HAVE BEEN DROPPED IN THE CITY.
IT IS ALSO BELIEVED THAT THE POLICE FORCE HAS BEEN OFFERED HEAVY
BRIBES TO ASSIST THE AGENTS.

TACTICS:

PROCEED WITH ALL SPEED TO THE TARGET AND TRY NOT TO GET TOO
DISTRACTED BY THE ENEMY AGENTS.

EMERGENCY UPDATE:

THERE IS AN INFORMER IN OUR ORGANISATION. ALREADY HE IS ON HIS WAY TO
WARN THE TARGET OF YOUR ARRIVAL. IF YOU CAN PREVENT HIM FROM REACHING
THE TARGET YOU WILL BUY YOURSELF SOME EXTRA TIME.
