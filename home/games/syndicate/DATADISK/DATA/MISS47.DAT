MEDICINE MAN.

EQUIPMENT AQUISITION.

CURRENT INFORMATION SOURCES HAVE INDICATED TO US THAT A NEW TYPE OF
MEDIKIT IS BEING DEVELOPED. WE BELIEVE IT TO BE IN TRANSIT TO A
SCIENTIST RESPONSIBLE FOR TESTING AND MASS PRODUCING IT FOR AN ENEMY
SYNDICATE.

WE MUST HAVE BOTH THE MEDIKIT AND THE SCIENTIST.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THE MEDIKIT IS BEING TRANSPORTED BY A SQUAD OF GUARDS. THEY WILL HAVE
TO BE DISPOSED OF. WHEN THE SCIENTIST IS LOCATED <PERSUADE> HIM AND
THEN EVACUATE THE AREA.

|
TACTICS:

IT MAY BE AN IDEA TO LET THE GUARDS GET CLOSE TO THE SCIENTIST BEFORE
HITTING THEM. THIS WILL REVEAL THE POSITION OF THE SCIENTIST FOR YOU
BUT WILL ALSO REQUIRE SPLIT SCEOND TIMING.
