XPPFG CAPTURE.

EQUIPMENT ACQUISTION.

RUMOUR HAS IT THAT A RIVAL SYNDICATE HAS DEVELOPED A PERSONAL PROTECTION FIELD GENERATOR CAPABLE OF RESISTING BULLETS WHILST 
STILL BEING SMALL ENOUGH TO BE CARRIED BY AN AGENT.

YOU DONT NEED ME TO TELL YOU THE EFFECT THIS WILL HAVE IN FUTURE CONFRONTATIONS AND OBVIOUSLY WE CANT LET THIS HAPPEN.

YOUR SQUAD IS TO PENETRATE THE ENEMY COMPLEX AND ACQUIRE THE PROTOTYPE.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

AS THIS IS SUCH A REVOLUTIONARY DEVICE EXPECT RESISTANCE TO BE FIERCE. AS FAR AS THE LATEST INTELLIGENCE REPORTS GO WE ARE LOOKING
AT SEVERAL ENEMY SQUADS ARMED WITH UZIS AND MINI GUNS. THESE SQUADS ROAM THE CITY ATTEMPTING TO INTERCEPT AND ELIMINATE ENEMY
ACTIONS BEFORE THE COMPLEX COMES UNDER THREAT.

|
DEFENCE UPDATE:

THE SECURITY NETWORK OF THE CITY IS FAIRLY LAX BUT THE SECURITY FORCES AROUND THE TARGET COMPLEX ITSELF ARE A FORCE TO BE RECKONED
WITH. WE ANTICIPATE SEVERAL GUARD UNITS WITH LIGHT WEAPONRY SUPPORTED BY ALMOST INACCESSIBLE HEAVY WEAPON SQUADS.

|
TACTICS:

GROUP TOGETHER FOR MAXIMUM DEFENCE AGAINST THE ENEMY SYNDICATE SQUADS. ONCE THESE ARE DISPATCHED THEN YOU CAN CONCENTRATE ON 
ADVANCING TO THE COMPLEX. ATTACK THE BUILDING ITSELF FROM TWO SIDES FORCING THE DEFENDERS TO SPLIT THEIR FIREPOWER. LONG RANGE 
WEAPONRY SHOULD PICK OFF GUARDS BEFORE THEY ARE IN CLOSE RANGE.
