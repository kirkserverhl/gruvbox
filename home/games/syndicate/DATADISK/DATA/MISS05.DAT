WE NEED YOU.

ASSASSINATION.

AN EXECUTIVE FROM A RIVAL SYNDICATE HAS STARTED A RECRUITMENT
CAMPAIGN FOR FRESH BLOOD TO THEIR AGENT PROGRAM. INITIAL RESPONSE HAS
BEEN STARTLINGLY IMPRESSIVE AND WE CANNOT RISK THIS CAMPAIGN BEING A
SUCCESS.

YOUR SQUAD IS TO ASSASSINATE THE EXECUTIVE BEFORE HE CAN PUT PHASE TWO
INTO OPERATION.

|
TARGET UPDATE:

THE TARGET IS BELIEVED TO BE IN A BUILDING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF TOWN.
WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT HE IS UNDER A MODERATE GUARD.

|
SYNDICATE UPDATE:

SOME OF THE AGENTS THAT YOU WILL ENCOUNTER ON THIS MISSION ARE THE
NEW RECRUITS. THEY HAVE BEEN MODIFIED TO FEEL NO PAIN OR FEAR. AS
SUCH THEY WILL PROVE TO BE VERY AGGRESSIVE WARRIORS.

|
TACTICS:

USE THEIR AGGRESSION AGAINST THEM WITH SUPERIOR FLANKING MANOUVERS
AND GOOD USE OF FIRE ARCS.
